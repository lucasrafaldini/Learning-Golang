# Learning Go with Ellen Korbes

This repository contains code examples and exercises from the "Learning Go with Ellen Korbes" course on YouTube. The course covers the basics of Go, including data types, control structures, functions, and concurrency.

## Course Information

The course is titled "Learn Go Programming - Golang Tutorial for Beginners" and is taught by Ellen Korbes. It's a beginner-friendly course that covers the basics of Go programming, including variables, functions, data structures, and more.

You can find the full course on YouTube.

## Getting Started

If you're new to Go programming, I recommend starting with the first video in the course and working your way through each subsequent video. If you're already familiar with Go, feel free to skip ahead to the videos that cover topics you're interested in.

To run the code examples on your local machine, you'll need to have Go installed. You can download Go from the official website.

Alternatively, you can run the code examples directly on Replit, an online code editor and platform that supports Go. To get started with Replit:

    Create an account on Replit.
    
    Fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of this page.
    
    Create a new Replit project by clicking the "New repl" button on your Replit dashboard.
    
    Choose "Import from GitHub" and select this repository.
    
    Once the project has been imported, you can run any of the code examples by clicking the "Run" button at the top of the code editor.

## Course Outline

The course is divided into the following modules:

    Introduction
    Data Types
    Control Structures
    Functions
    Packages
    Pointers
    Concurrency
    Conclusion

Each module contains a set of code examples and exercises that build on the concepts covered in the previous modules. The exercises are designed to reinforce your understanding of the material and provide an opportunity to practice writing Go code.
